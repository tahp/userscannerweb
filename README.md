- ✅ Clear **Available / Taken / Error** output for each platform.
- ✅ Fully modular: add new platform modules easily.
- ✅ Command-line interface ready: works directly after `pip install`.
- ✅ Can be used as username OSINT tool.

### Contributing: 

Modules are organized by category:

```
user_scanner/
├── dev/        # Developer platforms (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
├── social/     # Social platforms (Twitter/X, Reddit, Instagram, etc.)
├── creator/    # Creator platforms (Hashnode, Dev.to, Medium, etc.)
├── community/  # Community platforms (forums, niche sites)
├── gaming/     # Gaming sites (chess.com, and many more(upcoming))
```

**Module guidelines:**
- Each module must define a `validate_<site>()` function that takes a `username` and returns:
  - `1` → Available  
  - `0` → Taken  
  - `2` → Error / Could not check
- Use `httpx` for requests, `colorama` for colored output.
- Optional: modules can define a CLI parser if they support custom arguments.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for examples.
